## Story
Magium is a text based choose your own adventure game. In it, we follow Barry, a young man who has entered a mage
tournament with the surprising goal of becoming a mage in the first place.

This is a fan made recreation of the three original books created by the late Christian Mihailescu. This project intends
to create a more easily accessible form for playing the interactive story, to better preserve his stories once they are
taken off the various app stores Magium is currently offered on, and to eventually finish his stories collaboratively
based off of the notes for his original vision for the story.
